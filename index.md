## About Me



Hi! I am a Data Analyst with 3+ years of experience. I have completed my Masters in Computer Science from University of North Texas. I am actively involved in research.

## Research Interest

My research focuses on cybersecurity. Exploring ML and AI techniques for phishing detection, automated attack and defense strategies, malware detection, and autonomous vehicle security.

## some things I believe
> the best analysis starts with better questions
  * the framing defines the finding
  * creativity in querying > brute force modeling
  * data can’t speak — interpretation is the voice
> intuition and rigor are allies, not opposites
  * statistics is the skeleton, intuition is the soul
  * outliers aren’t noise — they’re often signals
  * lived experience and domain knowledge guide the best hypotheses
> AI is a tool, not a magic trick
  * the best ML models are boring, not magical
  * LLMs don’t think, but they can help you think faster
  * real impact = relevance × reliability
> execution is the differentiator
  * ideas are cheap, production is hard
  * reproducibility isn’t optional — it’s respect
  * “done” is better than “still tuning hyperparameters”
