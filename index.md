## About Me



Hi! I am a Data Analyst with 3+ years of experience. I have completed my Masters in Computer Science from University of North Texas. I am actively involved in research.

## Research Interest

My research focuses on cybersecurity. Exploring ML and AI techniques for phishing detection, automated attack and defense strategies, malware detection, and autonomous vehicle security.

## some things I believe
 * **the best analysis starts with better questions**
   *Great analysis isn’t about throwing models at data. It’s about asking the right questions first. The way a problem is framed often determines the insight it reveals. Creative, thoughtful querying beats brute-force computation every time.*

 * **intuition and rigor are allies, not opposites**
   *While statistics provide structure, intuition adds depth and direction. Outliers can hold hidden truth, and experience often guides where to look. True insight comes from balancing evidence with informed instinct.*

 * **AI is a tool, not a magic trick**
   *The best AI models are practical, explainable, and grounded in reality,not mysterious black boxes.Tools like LLMs enhance human thinking but don’t replace it.*
   
 * **execution is the differentiator**
   *Ideas alone don’t move the needle:  consistent, quality delivery does. Done is better than perfect.*
