## About Me



Hi! I’m a Data analyst and AI researcher with 3+ years of experience working at the intersection of analytics, machine learning, and business impact. My work spans credit risk modeling, fraud detection, customer behavior analysis. I have completed my Masters in Computer Science from University of North Texas.I enjoy turning complex datasets into clear, actionable insights and building scalable solutions using Python, SQL, cloud platforms, and modern BI tools. Whether it's developing predictive models, designing dashboards, or optimizing data pipelines, I focus on delivering results that are both technically sound and strategically meaningful. 


## some things I believe
 * **the best analysis starts with better questions**: *Great analysis isn’t about throwing models at data. It’s about asking the right questions first. The way a problem is framed often determines the insight it reveals. Creative, thoughtful querying beats brute-force computation every time.*

 * **intuition and rigor are allies, not opposites** : *While statistics provide structure, intuition adds depth and direction. Outliers can hold hidden truth, and experience often guides where to look. True insight comes from balancing evidence with informed instinct.*

 * **AI is a tool, not a magic trick** : *The best AI models are practical, explainable, and grounded in reality,not mysterious black boxes.Tools like LLMs enhance human thinking but don’t replace it.*
   
 * **execution is the differentiator** : *Ideas alone don’t move the needle:  consistent, quality delivery does. Done is better than perfect.*
