## Research Interest Areas: 
My research lies at the intersection of cybersecurity, AI, and digital systems, with a focus on leveraging machine learning and large language models (LLMs) for threat detection, privacy preservation, and secure infrastructure design. I explore how AI can both enhance and compromise digital security — from spam detection and e-health data protection to the offensive and defensive use of generative AI in cyber warfare.My work also includes architectural reviews of NoC systems in heterogeneous multicore environments and the ethical implications of emerging technologies like deepfakes. I'm particularly interested in building resilient, scalable, and ethically grounded AI systems that address real-world security challenges in an increasingly automated and interconnected world.

I invite you to read my publications to uncover the research problems and areas of interest that have been central to my research journey. This will provide you with valuable insights into my expertise and focus.


## Research Publications: 
>**2024**

1. **Introduction to Deepfakes and its early foundations.**[*Book Chapter Published in IGI Global*](https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/introduction-to-deepfake-technology-and-its-early-foundations/364345)
   * Authored a book chapter analyzing the **development, creation, detection, and mitigation of deepfake technology, emphasizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**. Explored real-world applications, ethical considerations, and the future trajectory of deepfakes, addressing misinformation, privacy, and security concerns.
Provided insights into rapidly evolving challenges posed by hyper-realistic synthetic media across diverse industries.
      
2. **Cross Model Analysis of Large Language Models and Machine Learning Models in classifying Spam SMS.**[*Published at 8th Cyber Security in Networking Conference (CSNet 2024).*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851763) 
   * Evaluated traditional ML models (**SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, KNN, XGBoost**) and LLMs for spam detection, establishing a robust baseline and addressing the critical need for effective mechanisms against sophisticated cyber threats.
   * Extended the analysis to LLMs (**ChatGPT 3.5, Perplexity AI, and a custom fine-tuned GPT**), revealing their exceptional potential to enhance spam detection. While traditional ML models remain effective, LLMs demonstrate promising applications, highlighting the strengths of both classical and advanced approaches.
     
3. **Using Generative AI as a tactical weapon to Create and Counter Cyber Attacks.**[*Arxiv*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12806)
   * We explored the misuse of AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), in cybersecurity, demonstrating how techniques like the *switch method and character play method can be exploited to generate and automate cyber attacks.*
   * Through controlled experiments, we presented how **LLMs can be manipulated to bypass ethical safeguards and generate various cyber attacks, including social engineering, malicious code, payload generation, and spyware.**
   * Introduced "**Occupy AI**", a customized, fine-tuned LLM specifically *designed to automate and execute cyberattacks*, *capable of crafting steps and generating executable code for various cyber threats*.
   * Emphasized the urgent need for *ethical AI practices, robust cybersecurity measures, and regulatory oversight* to mitigate AI-related threats and protect against emerging cyber dangers in the evolving digital landscape.
   
4. **Security and privacy in E-health systems: a review of AI and machine learning techniques.**[*Published in IEEE ACCESS*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10697161)
    * Analyzed the evolution of e-health systems from paper records to advanced EHRs, exploring their components and applications, and presented emerging AI-driven cybersecurity trends,     emphasizing real-time threat detection, predictive analytics, and scalability for safeguarding sensitive health data.
   * Discussed how AI fortifies e-health data security through anomaly detection and adaptive learning, boosting threat detection and response efficiency, and explored future directions—including quantum-resistant encryption, privacy-preserving AI, automated compliance, blockchain-secured interoperability, and ethical AI—to build resilient and secure healthcare infrastructures.


5. **Survey of Network-on-Chip (NoC) for Heterogeneous Multicore Systems**[* Published at IEEE 17th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore Systems-on-Chip (MCSoC)*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10819599)
   * This paper systematically reviews recent research on *NoC designs tailored for hardware accelerators and heterogeneous integrations, distilling key architectural innovations, performance insights, outstanding challenges,* and promising avenues for future NoC development.
   * As chip technologies advance and **multi-core systems integrate CPUs with GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs, onchip communication becomes a critical bottleneck**. Traditional NoC architectures—originally designed for CPU-only multi-cores—struggle to meet the variable, high-bandwidth, and diverse traffic patterns of these heterogeneous platforms.
