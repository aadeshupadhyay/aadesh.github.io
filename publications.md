## Research Interest Areas: 
My research lies at the intersection of cybersecurity, AI, and digital systems, with a focus on leveraging machine learning and large language models (LLMs) for threat detection, privacy preservation, and secure infrastructure design. I explore how AI can both enhance and compromise digital security — from spam detection and e-health data protection to the offensive and defensive use of generative AI in cyber warfare.My work also includes architectural reviews of NoC systems in heterogeneous multicore environments and the ethical implications of emerging technologies like deepfakes. I'm particularly interested in building resilient, scalable, and ethically grounded AI systems that address real-world security challenges in an increasingly automated and interconnected world.

## Research Publications: 
>2024
1. **Security and privacy in E-health systems: a review of AI and machine learning techniques.** [*Published in IEEE ACCESS*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10697161)
    *Analyzed the evolution of e-health systems from paper records to advanced EHRs, exploring their components and applications, and presented emerging AI-driven cybersecurity trends,     emphasizing real-time threat detection, predictive analytics, and scalability for safeguarding sensitive health data.
   *Discussed how AI fortifies e-health data security through anomaly detection and adaptive learning, boosting threat detection and response efficiency, and explored future directions—including quantum-resistant encryption, privacy-preserving AI, automated compliance, blockchain-secured interoperability, and ethical AI—to build resilient and secure healthcare infrastructures.
2. **Survey of Network-on-Chip (NoC) for Heterogeneous Multicore Systems**[*IEEE 17th International Symposium on Embedded Multicore Systems-on-Chip (MCSoC)*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10819599)
  * This paper systematically reviews recent research on NoC designs tailored for hardware accelerators and heterogeneous integrations, distilling key architectural innovations, performance insights, outstanding challenges, and promising avenues for future NoC development.
  * As chip technologies advance and multi-core systems integrate CPUs with GPUs, FPGAs, and ASICs, onchip communication becomes a critical bottleneck. Traditional NoC architectures—originally designed for CPU-only multi-cores—struggle to meet the variable, high-bandwidth, and diverse traffic patterns of these heterogeneous platforms.
